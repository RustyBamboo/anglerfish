This  ROS node will read messages published to the /imu/data and /imu/mag topics. For the moment it only performs magnetometer calibration. 

* To run the node

rosrun calibrate_imu calibrate_imu.py

* To start collecting samples from the IMU

rosservice call /start_sampling

* To calibrate the magnetometer using the current data samples

rosservice call /calibrate_mag

This will store the calibration parameters in a file called "mag_calibration_d_m_y_H_M_S", where d_m_y_H_M_S is the time the file was created.  For an example on how to read the file you can look at the plot_calibration_data.py script

* To visualize the raw data from the magnetometer and the calibrated data

./plot_calibration_data.py mag_calibration_d_m_y_H_M_S
